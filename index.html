      <p>
        Roger Federer has bowed out of the Australian Open with a shock four-set
        loss to Stefanos Tsitsipas.
      </p>
      <p>
        Federer's chances of winning a third consecutive Australian Open title
        were ended as the 20-year-old came of age on Rod Laver Arena.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Greek, who was not born when Federer made his professional debut,
        has rapidly established himself as one of the most exciting
        up-and-coming talents in the game and backed it up spectacularly with a
        6-7 (11) 7-6 (3) 7-5 7-6 (5) victory to move through to a first slam
        quarter-final.
      </p>
      <p>
        Federer had not lost a match at Melbourne Park since a semi-final defeat
        by Novak Djokovic in 2016 but his often-brilliant forehand was wayward,
        especially at the big moments, and he failed to take four set points in
        the second set which might well have changed the outcome.

        For the first time all evening, Tsitsipas looked overwhelmed as he
        stepped out for the on-court interview, saying: "I'm the happiest man on
        earth right now. I cannot describe it.
      </p>
      <p>
        "From the very beginning it was very important to keep that mindset, to
        believe in yourself, believe in your capabilities.

        "Roger is a legend of the sport, so much respect for him. He showed such
        good tennis over the years. I've been idolising him since the age of
        six.
      </p>
      <p>
        "It was a dream come true just being on Rod Laver facing him. Winning at
        the end, I cannot describe it."
      </p>
      <p>
        "I had an aggressive mindset from the start, stayed in the moment, got
        first serves in and tried to press. I didn't lose my patience and that
        was the key.
      </p>
      <p>
        "I showed fighting spirit and had most of the crowd supporting me. I
        haven't seen such a large crowd all my life. The atmosphere, the vibes
        and the energy shown to Roger and me today was indescribable."
